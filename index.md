<h6 class="font-italic pb-3"><b>Salford Quays Community Forum</b> is both a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/212736346267034" target="_blank">Facebook group</a> and a real-world group of individuals who are trying to change the world (or at least, our little bit of the world!).</h6>

        <h2>What are we up to?</h2>
        SQCF has three key areas of focus:
        <ul>
            <li>Community Building</li>
            <li>Physical Environment</li>
            <li>Crime and Anti-Social Behaviour</li> 
        </ul>
        Each area of focus has Working Party Groups that work together to achieve positive outcomes. 
        
        Each group has a leading member who organises meetings, agendas and related points.
        
        These leading members are part of the SQCF Steering Committee (Board).

        <h2>Get Involved</h2>
    
        Join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/212736346267034" target="_blank">Facebook group</a> below or to join the real-world group email <a href="mailto:jonathandmoore70@gmail.com" target="_blank">Jonathan Moore</a> with the name of the development you live on or the name of your employer.
        Members of the full group receive regular newsletters, can take part in our various working groups on themed topics, are consulted on a range of matters, and are eligible for leadership positions within what will eventually become (we hope) the largest community group in the north-west.
