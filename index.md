SQCF has three key areas of focus:

- Community Building
- Physical Environment
- Crime and Anti-Social Behaviour 

Each area of focus has Working Party Groups that work together to achieve positive outcomes. 

Each group has a leading member who organises meetings, agendas and related points.

These leading members are part of the SQCF Steering Committee (Board).
