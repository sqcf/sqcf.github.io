# Constitution

The organisation will be called ‘Salford Quays Community Forum’ or ‘SQCF’ (hereinafter will
be referred to as “The Forum”).
The Forum shall operate throughout the territory known as Salford Quays (including
MediaCityUK).

## Aims and Objectives
The Forum is a non-political organisation that seeks to represent and promote the interests
of the residents, businesses and organisations of Salford Quays.
The aims and objectives of The Forum are:
- to work in harmony as a united voice to tackle any problems or challenges within our
local area;
- to foster and encourage the growth of community spirit;
- to preserve, protect and improve the area defined as Salford Quays.
- any other matter which the Steering Committee deems to be appropriate

## Membership
Membership of The Forum is open to anyone interested in furthering the aims and objectives
of The Forum, regardless of sex, age, disability, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation,
religion or other beliefs, providing they meet The Forum’s qualifying criteria.
To qualify for membership, a member must normally either:
- Live within the area known as Salford Quays (either as an owner-occupier or as a
tenant), or
- Own a property within the area known as Salford Quays, but be resident elsewhere,
or
- Work for an employer which is based within the area known as Salford Quays

As The Forum is non-political, politicians may only hold full membership if they either reside
within the area in which the group operates, or hold employment (other than being a
politician) with an employer based within the area in which The Forum operates. Any
politician who does not meet the qualifying criteria for membership may attend meetings at
the invitation of the Chair or Secretary.
Membership is effected by subscribing to The Forum’s membership list. To subscribe, a
person must supply (as a minimum) their name, their email address and the name of either
the development they live on, or the name of their employer if they work at Salford Quays.
The Forum operates a Facebook Page, with a large membership. For clarity, membership of
the Facebook Page does not of itself constitute membership of The Forum.

Individuals shall not be eligible to take part in the business of The Forum, vote at general
meetings or be eligible for election to the Committee unless they are aged 18 years or over
and meet The Forum’s qualifying criteria.
Membership will terminate upon the member requesting cessation of membership in writing
to the Secretary.
The Forum has the power to terminate the membership of any member whose conduct is
considered to have brought the Forum into disrepute. Decisions to terminate membership
will be made at a meeting of the Steering Committee and will be agreed via a majority vote.
The Steering Committee is not obliged to provide advance notice of the meeting to the
member whose membership is to be debated, and the decision of the Steering Committee is
final.

Non-voting Associate Membership may be offered to those who do not meet the eligibility criteria
for full membership, but who can demonstrate an ongoing interest in the future of The Quays, and
who subscribe to the Forum&#39;s objectives

## The Steering Committee
The affairs of The Forum shall be conducted by a Steering Committee which shall consist of
the Officers and co-opted members.
The Officers shall be the Chair, Treasurer, and Secretary, who shall be elected at the Annual
General Meeting.
The Officers may appoint co-opted members to the Steering Committee.
In addition to elected Officers and co-opted members, any Working Party which is run by
The Forum will send a delegate to Steering Committee meetings, and this will ordinarily be
the Lead Person/Convenor for that Working Party. The Working Party Delegate will hold full
voting and decision-making rights as part of their membership of the Steering Committee.
All Steering Committee members must be Members of The Forum.
The term of office shall be for one year, and Members shall be eligible for re-election.
If any Officer post should fall vacant after such an election, the Steering Committee shall
have the power to appoint to the vacancy until the succeeding Annual General Meeting.
The Steering Committee will have powers to:
- appoint any advisers to the Steering Committee as necessary to fulfil its business;
- raise money so long as in doing so The Forum does not undertake any permanent or
substantial trading activity;
- cooperate with any other group and exchange information and advice with them,
subject to applicable data protection regulations;
- do all things lawful in furtherance of the aims and objectives of The Forum.

The Steering Committee meetings will be convened by the Secretary and be held no less
than quarterly, but normally will meet at monthly intervals.
All Steering Committee members will have equal voting rights at Committee Meetings, and
matters will be decided by a simple majority vote. In the event of a tied vote, the Chair shall
have a casting vote.
The quorum required for business to be agreed at Committee meetings will be 50% of
Steering Committee members, including at least one named officer.

No member of the Committee will have any interest in any decision of the Steering
Committee other than as a member of the Steering Committee.
No member of the Committee will receive any remuneration, other than out of pocket
expenses if agreed, or have any interest in any contract entered into by the Steering
Committee.

A statement of annual accounts will be presented by the Treasurer at the Annual General
Meeting.
Any cheques drawn against Forum funds should hold the signatures of two Steering
Committee members.
All monies and resources will be to further the aims and objectives of The Forum, providing
this will not prevent the payment of out of pocket expenses where agreed, and only on
production of receipts.
